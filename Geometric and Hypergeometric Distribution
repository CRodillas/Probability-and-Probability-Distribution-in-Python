Geometric Distribution

``` r
p_success <- 0.2
x <- rgeom(1000, p_success)

mean_x <- mean(x)
var_x <- var(x)
sd_x <- sd(x)
first_success <- which.min(x)

cat("Number of trials required to have first success: ", first_success, "\n")
```

    ## Number of trials required to have first success:  1

``` r
cat("Mean (in 2 decimal places): ", round((mean_x),2), "\n")
```

    ## Mean (in 2 decimal places):  4.15

``` r
cat("Variance (in 2 decimal places): ", round((var_x),2), "\n")
```

    ## Variance (in 2 decimal places):  20.31

``` r
cat("Standard Deviation (in 2 decimal places): ", round((sd_x),2), "\n")
```

    ## Standard Deviation (in 2 decimal places):  4.51

Plot the histogram:

``` r
hist(x, main = "Geometric Distribution Results", xlab = "Number of Trials", ylab = "Frequency of Occurence", breaks = 20, col="lightgreen")
